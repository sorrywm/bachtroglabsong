Files related to analysis of courtship song in nasuta, ananassae, virilis, and athabasca subgroups

This repo contains a collection of wrapper scripts for processing multi-channel .wav audio files and corresponding spreadsheets formatted as in the example RecordingTemplate.xlsx, which contain information about flies whose songs have been recorded in the multi-channel .wav files. Scripts are written primarily in MATLAB, with some post-processing in R. Pulse song identification scripts rely on software developed by the Stern and Murthy labs at Princeton, specifically FlySongSegmenter (available at https://github.com/FlyCourtship/FlySongSegmenter) and FlySongClusterSegment (in development).

The latest/most broadly applicable script for each of the following tasks is listed below:<p>
1) Extract individual channels from a 32-channel .wav file:
makeWaves_savio_raw.m 
2) Implement a high-pass filter on an individual .wav file (using Ty Hedrick's wrapper for the Matlab Signal Processing Toolbox Butterworth filter):
FilterAndPlot.m 
3) Generate pulse templates from a single-channel .wav file:
CreateSpeciesTemplatesFiltLoadOpts.m 
4) Identify pulses within a single-channel .wav file:
RunClusteringOneChannelFilt5pmLoadOpts.m 
5) Characterize flies in spreadsheet by contents of Notes cell (currently identifies indicators of wing damage, though this could be modified for other text searches):
findDamagedMales.m 
6) Summarize parameters of pulse song from the output of pulse identification for a set of songs:
SummarizeSongStatdist.R

The MATLAB files nasutaoptionssavio.mat and virilisoptionssavio.mat contain both system-specific paths for files, scripts, and dependencies, and parameters optimized for these species' songs. The folderMap.mat file contains a mapping of species names to the four clades for which the Bachtrog lab has recordings.
